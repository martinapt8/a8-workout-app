# A8 Workout Challenge App V2

## Project Overview
A collective goal-oriented workout tracking web app for team building at A8. Features a single challenge period with rotating workouts and a shared company-wide goal. Teams and individuals contribute to one collective target (e.g., 200 workouts in October). Built as a lightweight Google Apps Script web app with personalized URL access.

## Core Philosophy
- **Collective Achievement**: Focus on group goal vs individual streaks
- **Workout Variety**: Multiple workouts scheduled throughout challenge period
- **Team Contribution**: Teams work together toward single company goal
- **Flexibility**: Users can log prescribed workouts or external workouts
- **Minimal Friction**: No passwords, no app downloads, bookmark your personal URL

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Two HTML Files**:
  - `index.html`: Core HTML structure and JavaScript logic
  - `styles.html`: Separated CSS with Base64 embedded Roobert fonts (5 weights)
- **Five-Page SPA**: Today, Team Progress, Me, Workout Library, and A8AI Generator
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for quick phone access
- **A8 Brand Colors**: Black (#000000), Yellow (#FFC107), White (#FFFFFF)
- **AI Integration**: Claude API for dynamic workout generation

### Backend
- **Google Sheets Database**: 5 sheets for Users, Workouts, Completions, Settings, Coaching
- **Google Apps Script**: Server logic with simplified operations
- **No Authentication**: URL parameters identify users (`?user=martin`)
- **CORS Solution**: Uses form-encoded POST (URLSearchParams) instead of JSON to bypass CORS preflight restrictions

   - Share base URL with team

### Managing During Challenge
- **View Progress**: Check Completions sheet for real-time data
- **Update Workouts**: Can add/modify future workouts anytime
- **Track Engagement**: Monitor Settings sheet for participation
- **Export Data**: Download Completions sheet for analysis
- **User Management**: Use "A8 Custom Menu" → "Migrate Form Responses" to add new users
- **Email Communications**:
  - Use "A8 Custom Menu" → "Send Welcome Email" for initial onboarding
  - Use "A8 Custom Menu" → "Send Update Email" for mid-challenge updates with new deployment links
- **Slack Integration**: Use "A8 Custom Menu" → "Send Slack Progress Update" for manual progress updates
- **Coaching Tips**: Add daily tips to Coaching sheet (date in Column A, tip in Column B) for Slack integration
- **Timezone Note**: All times use the timezone configured in Settings sheet for consistency

### Adding Video Links to Movements
To add instructional video links to workout movements:
1. **Select the movement cell** in any `movement_X` column in the Workouts sheet
2. **Insert hyperlink**: Use Insert → Link (or Ctrl/Cmd+K)
3. **Enter the video URL**: Paste YouTube or other video link
4. **The cell will display** the exercise name as hyperlinked text
5. **Users will see** the movement as a clickable link with:
   - Yellow color and underline for visibility
   - External link icon (↗) indicating it opens in new tab
   - Videos open in new tab when clicked

## API Endpoints

### REST API (GitHub Pages deployment)

**Base URL**: Configured in `config.js`

All API requests use **form-encoded POST** to avoid CORS preflight:
```javascript
const formData = new URLSearchParams();
formData.append('payload', JSON.stringify({
  action: 'markWorkoutComplete',
  userId: 'username',
  workoutType: 'prescribed',
  workoutDetails: '',
  completionDate: null
}));

fetch(API_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
});
```

**Available Actions**:
- `getDashboard` - Get user dashboard data
- `getGoalProgress` - Get team progress
- `getAllWorkouts` - Get workout library
- `getUserCompletionHistory` - Get user's completion dates
- `generateAIWorkout` - Generate AI workout
- `markWorkoutComplete` - Log a workout (POST only)

**Why form-encoded?** Google Apps Script has CORS restrictions that prevent JSON POST requests from triggering preflight OPTIONS requests. Using URLSearchParams bypasses this limitation.

- [ ] **Populate at least one workout** for launch day with proper date ranges
- [ ] **Set correct challenge dates** in Settings (start_date, end_date)
- [ ] **Test on actual mobile devices**, not just browser dev tools

### Data Validation
- [ ] Check for duplicate user_ids in Users sheet
- [ ] Verify team colors are valid hex codes
- [ ] **Ensure all workouts have valid start_date and end_date** (invalid dates will be skipped in library)
- [ ] Ensure workout date ranges don't have gaps (unless intentional rest days)
- [ ] Test "Other Workout" with maximum length text (100 characters)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] If using Slack, verify SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL in Script Properties
- [ ] Test form migration if using Google Forms for signup
- [ ] Send test welcome email to verify email configuration
- [ ] Check that all admin menu functions work properly

## Deployment Steps

1. **Create Google Sheet**:
   - New Google Sheet with 5 tabs
   - Name tabs: Users, Workouts, Completions, Settings, Coaching

2. **Add Apps Script**:
   - Tools → Script Editor
   - Create Code.gs, index.html, styles.html
   - Copy code from this project

3. **Configure Settings**:
   - Add challenge configuration to Settings sheet
   - **IMPORTANT**: Add `timezone` setting (e.g., `America/New_York`)
   - Populate Users with team members (ensure user_ids are lowercase)
   - Add initial workouts

4. **Deploy Web App**:
   - Deploy → New Deployment
   - Type: Web App
   - Execute as: Me
   - Access: Anyone
   - Copy deployment URL

5. **Generate User URLs**:
   - Base URL + ?user=[user_id]
   - Share with each team member

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics
- **Participation Rate**: Daily active users / Total users
- **Goal Progress**: Total completions / Goal
- **Team Balance**: Completions per team
- **Workout Type Split**: Prescribed vs External

### Data Export
- Download Completions sheet as CSV
- Analyze in Excel/Sheets
- Track week-over-week trends
- Identify engagement patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"User not found"**: Check user_id in URL matches Users sheet exactly
2. **No workout showing**: Verify date ranges in Workouts sheet
3. **Completion not saving**: Check script permissions and execution
4. **Slow loading**: Consider reducing Recent Activity items

### Debug Mode
Add `?debug=true` to URL for console logging (implement in Code.gs)
